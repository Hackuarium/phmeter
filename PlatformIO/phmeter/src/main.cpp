/**
 * @mainpage pHMeter Documentation
 *
 * @section description Description
 * Ths project is develop to control and adquire pH and conductimetry in
 * the principal project [Bioreactor](https://github.com/Hackuarium/bioreactor).
 * The source code documentation was made with Doxygen.
 *
 * @section circuit Circuit
 * - Microcontroller ATMEGA32U4.
 * - Buck converter from 5V and 12 V to 3.3 V.
 * - Battery charge.
 * - I2C communication.
 * - USB connection.
 * - Adquistion for pH.
 * - Adquisition for conductimetry.
 * - 24 bits ADC for pH and conductimetry.
 * - 4 I/O connections to control pH and conductimetry.
 * - One-wire communication.
 * - Temperature sense and control.
 * - 64 Mbits SPI memory.
 * - LCD 16x2 display.
 * - Rotary push button.
 * - Momentary push button connected to pin D3.
 *
 * @section libraries Libraries
 * - nilRTOS (https://github.com/greiman/NilRTOS-Arduino)
 *   - RTOS create threads for every component in the board.
 *
 * @section notes Notes
 * - Comments are Doxygen compatible.
 *
 * @section todo TODO
 * - Don't use Doxygen style formatting inside the body of a function.
